* The practical project is a summary of the activities carried out up to this point through the implementation of the source code.

### DESCRIPTION

As part of the project, a system should be created to collect data from one or preferably two/three weather services (or use files) and provide the average (the result should be a given weather value calculated as the arithmetic average of the results returned by each service) values calculated on the basis of the responses returned.

### FUNCTIONALITIES
* Downloading weather data from relevant web services (or files on your local disc)
